<h1>PJ's Top Games 2024</h1>
<h2>A recap of the best titles of this year</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>1. Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h3>
<p>Essentially a sequel to already one of the best games of all time.  I can't believe they call this a DLC.  The amount of content is ridiculous.</p>

<h3>2. Black Myth Wukong</h3>
<p>Incredibly fluid gameplay, fun boss fights, and an interesting story.</p>

<h3>3. Another Crab's Treasure</h3>
<p> A fresh take on the souls-like genre, and a lot of fun.</p>
